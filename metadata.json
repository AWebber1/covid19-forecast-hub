Our formulation draws on core methods from both epidemiology and physics. It is data-driven to characterize non-linear transition rates and posits underlying causal mechanisms that we have verified against mobility indices representing physical distancing in mass scale and government response actions. Our models recalibrate daily with the arrival of new information on COVID-19. By design, the calibration of our models use region-specific data, as the differences in the timing and execution of government restrictions, testing, population density, social behaviour norms and public responses, re-opening plans, and demographics are extremely relevant.

Each of these adjacency matrices is associated with a weight to indicate its overall activation strength, and places a finite number of edges between a finite subset of nodes belonging to the same community. We use the generated random graph, whose number of nonzero-degree nodes is finite, to define both the sparsity patterns and dimensions of the latent state transition matrices of generalized linear dynamical systems. We show how the formed overlapping communities in the latent space can provide interpretable latent transition patterns of the COVID-19 time series, providing good predictive performance and uncertainty estimation."

Our projections are driven by the effective transmission ratio, Rt. More specifically we run an SIR model using deaths and another using cases resulting in Rt for deaths and Rt for cases. To forecast how Rt will change with time, we analyze Rt change data through the course of the pandemic and apply a model of that characteristic behavior to forecast infections and deaths.

Upon initiation of projections, all counties with 10 or more confirmed cases impose a 30% contact rate reduction. Each week following, if a county newly exceeds 10 confirmed cases, a 30% contact rate reduction is imposed, depending on the projection scenario. Counties that had previously exceeded 10 confirmed cases and also experience an increase in the number of weekly reported confirmed cases impose a further, multiplicative 30% contact rate reduction, depending on the projection scenario.

Model parameters describing reporting rates and transmission rates are allowed to vary in time over over the historical record as social and policy factors change. Forecasts into the future, however, are made under the assumption that the parameters are held constant in time.\nThe model parameters are estimated from observations of the cumulative number of cases using a Bayesian approach. Information from subject matter experts (SMEs) is used to develop a prior probability distribution over the model parameters. This then combined with a statistical model of the model-data mismatch to produce a posterior probability distribution over the model parameters that incorporates both the cumulative observations and subject matter expertise. The parameters that maximize the posterior probability density are used to make forecasts into the future. The effective reproduction number is computed using the next-generation matrix method.\nDeaths are estimated from this model through a procedure which leverages state-level data on recoveries and fatalities."

We modified the model parameters to represent the natural history of COVID-19 and calibrated a set of parameters to reproduce current trends of deaths due to COVID-19 in the US. FRED simulates the spread of the virus in a population by recreating interactions among people on a daily basis. To accurately represent the population of each of the states simulated, we used a synthetic population of the US that represents demographic and geographic characteristics of the population in 2010 (Wheaton 2012). Each human is modeled as an agent that visits a set of places defined by their activity space. This activity space contains places such as households, schools, workplaces, or neighborhood locations. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 can occur when an infected person visits the same location as a susceptible person on the same day. Numbers of contacts per person are specific to each place type. For instance, school contacts do not depend on the size of the school but the age of the agent. Infected agents have a probability to stay at home if they develop symptoms. Those who do not stay at home continue their daily activities. Public health interventions are included in the model to represent the changes in agents\u2019 behavior in response to an epidemic. In this study, we limited the interventions to school closure and shelter in place. Schools are closed on a specific date to represent state-level guidelines (IHME COVID-19 health service utilization forecasting Team and Murray 2020). In the case that schools are closed, students limit their activity space to household or neighborhood locations. Shelter-in-place interventions reduce each agent\u2019s activity space to their household at a compliance level from 0-100%, which was estimated as part of the model calibration. Agents who do not comply with the shelter-in-place orders continue with their daily routines. We used state-level orders to determine the date at which people are advised to shelter in place (IHME COVID-19 health service utilization forecasting Team and Murray 2020). See the methods file in our repo for more detailed methods and model limitations.\nUpdates 2020-05-11 - We updated our likelihood used in our calibration, switching from a Poisson to a negative binomial distribution in order to allow for greater over-dispersion in the distribution of deaths. - We changed the way that we calculate the proportion of the population that is sheltering in place. We no longer use the dates at which government advisories were issued. Instead, we now exclusively use the google mobility data (https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/) on journeys made to residential locations. We calibrate the maximum compliance to shelter in place, and use a generalized additive model fitted to the google data to forecast movement in the coming 5 weeks. For more details on this approach, see the methods file in our repo."

Without any social- distancing policy or geological/demographic inputs, the model works very well for the twenty hardest-hit counties in the United States. This model is quite different from other models yet provide parameters with clear physical meaning. We have shown the cumulative mobility plays the role of time in controling exponential growth of outbreak. Furthermore, there exists a critical relative mobility above which outbreak will occur. For NYC, this critical relative mobility is 30%. The critical relative mobility is ~60% for all other counties. In this forecast, we chose the ~30 heaviest hit states, while combine the rest of the states together into one superstate. This practice is necessary to obtain meaningful model parameters. The forecast is based on Eq. 3 of the citation above, fatality-reference, which is the average of the 11-day-period prior to prediction-date. The cumulative mobility is the average of three Google mobility categories: retail and recreation, transit station and work place. We have shown in our paper those three categorites behave similarly. We conducted standard error analysis on our forecast in which the uncertainty comes from both the fitting error and the variation of the reference fatality. Quantile forecast is calculated based on standard error assuming normal distribution. State-level forecast has been included for 32 states. Other states and county-level forecast will be included later. Starting Nov 29th, we included a summer reduction of 10% from 06/01 to 09/01 and an election mobility increase of 25% from 09/01 to 11/03. The summer reduction of mobility accounts for elevated outdoor activities while election mobility increase accounts for large gatherings of political rally which maybe washed out in the averaged state-mobility. We assume 80% of the vulnerable population will be vaccinated within two months. The assumption is antibody will be effective 3 weeks after the first shot. To account for the recent mutations, we increases the infection rate by 5%. Two vaccination scenarios have been considered and predicted which are shown in our website. Google mobility data may have been affected by a recent Sep update. "

We infer a common statewide pre-intervention transmission rate, and a separate post-intervention transmission rate for each of the four regions. We also infer a region-specific initial number of infected individuals. Other model parameters are informed by Illinois-specific data or best estimates from existing literature. We fit the model to incident in-hospital deaths and confirmed COVID-19 ICU cases prior to May 15, 2020.  For inference, we use maximum likelihood inference via sequential Monte Carlo for partially observed Markov process models (POMP).  We assume that hospitalized deaths are reported with probability 0.8075 and we fitted the reporting rate of non-hospitalized deaths. The model can be adapted to investigate different types of interventions. We currently model shelter-in-place as a reduction in the overall transmission rate, which is shared by all infected individuals, and reductions in age- and location-specific contact rates.\nTo model the relaxing of shelter-in-place interventions, we project three different scenarios. 1) The inferred post-intervention transmission rate remains unchanged. We assume that this is maximum reduction in transmission and call this model CovidIL_100. 2) The post-SIP transmission rate increases 10% of the way back to pre-SIP transmission according to a logistic function centered on June 1. We call this model CovidIL_10_increase. 3) The post-SIP transmission rate increases 30% of the way back to pre-SIP transmission according to a logistic function centered on June 1.

The model underlying each is a deterministic, SEIR-like model. Model simulations are initiated by imported infections, which arrive from January 1 onward according to a scaled Normal probability density. Each imported and then local infection gives rise to an average number of secondary infections distributed forward in time according to a generation interval distribution. Once infected, a proportion of those infected die at times distributed according to a distribution between symptom onset and death. Testing of a subset of symptomatic infections is distributed in time in a similar manner, and the model is fitted to data on test positivity by accounting for those seeking testing and a differential probabililty of seeking testing conditional on one's infection status. The model is simultaneously fitted to deaths according to a Poisson likelihood of daily incidence of death. There are a total of twelve model parameters that are all estimated. First, a parameter sweep is conducted to identify the parameter combination from the sweep with the highest likelihood. Then, a region around that parameter combination is assumed to have a uniform prior, and a posterior set of parameters is obtained with MCMC. The model is then simulated forward under each sampled parameter set from the posterior distribution. This process is repeated for each of nine mobility metrics from Apple and Google for 50 states and some territories where at least one type of mobility data is available. Simulations from the posterior predictive distribution of each model are pooled evenly and used to generate a probabilistic forecast in each state and at the national level."

Both reported infections (Ir) and unreported infections (Iu) contribute to disease spread, but at different rates - a low spread for people quarantined in compartment Ir, and a high spread for, often, asymptomatic people in compartment Iu. This handles the quarantine measures taken by countries to limit the infections. Some people in reported infections (Iu) recover (compartment C) and some die (compartment D) All people in unreported infections (Iu) recover (compartment Cu), there are no mortalities in this compartment. If their symptoms were serious enough they would be reported (and therefore in compartment Ir). We fit our model to reported confirmed cases and reported deaths in a region to estimate beta1 and beta2 for that region. For other parameters, we use estimates from other studies as starting point and learn using hyperparameter optimization that minimizes the error between projected daily deaths and reported daily deaths."

Change 2020-10-29: The growth parameter can be thought of as the transmissibility of the virus in that state on that date and is a weighted regression between the  trend in the growth rate over the past 42 days and a growth rate that would keep the number of new daily confirmed cases constant. The weights of these two components are dynamically tuned to the observed data. To model new deaths in the population, we assume that a fraction of the 1,2,3,4, or 5-week moving average of the daily confirmed cases will die. The model learns both the moving average window and the case fatality fraction that best fits the historical observations."

Each model compartment is sub-divided into nine different age categories. To model the state of Illinois, we divide the state into 3 regions based on similarities in epidemic dynamics. We infer a common statewide pre-intervention transmission rate, and a separate post-intervention transmission rate for each of the three regions. We also infer a region-specific initial number of infected individuals. Other model parameters are informed by Illinois-specific data or best estimates from existing literature. We fit the model to incident in-hospital deaths and confirmed COVID-19 ICU cases prior to May 8, 2020.  For inference, we use maximum likelihood inference via sequential Monte Carlo for partially observed Markov process models (POMP). \t We assume that hospitalized deaths are reported with probability 0.8075. Because we do not know what might cause underreporting of non-hospitalized deaths, our simulations integrate over that uncertainty by assuming that the reporting rate for non-hospitalized deaths is uniformly distributed from 0.25 to 0.75. The model can be adapted to investigate different types of interventions. We currently model shelter-in-place as a reduction in the overall transmission rate, which is shared by all infected individuals, and reductions in age- and location-specific contact rates.\nTo model the relaxing of shelter-in-place interventions, we project four different scenarios. 1) The inferred post-intervention transmission rate remains unchanged. We assume that this is maximum reduction in transmission and call this model CovidIL_100. At our current estimates, this corresponds to a 78% reduction in pre-intervention transmission. 2) Transmission rates increase to 80% of the maximum reduction in transmission according to a logistic function centered on May 29. We call this model CovidIL_80. At our current estimates, this corresopnds to a 74% reduction in pre-intervention transmission. 3) Transmission rates increase to 60% of the maximum reduction in transmission according to a logistic function centered on May 29. We call this model CovidIL_60. At our current estimates, this corresopnds to a 69% reduction in pre-intervention transmission. 4) Transmission rates increase to 40% of the maximum reduction in transmission according to a logistic function centered on May 29. We call this model CovidIL_40. At our current estimates, this corresopnds to a 65% reduction in pre-intervention transmission."

Therefore, we carefully avoid the data leakage issue. Hawkes processes are used in machine learning for event clustering and causal inference, while they also can be viewed as stochastic versions of popular compartmental models used in epidemiology. Here we show how to develop accurate models of COVID-19 transmission using Hawkes processes with spatial-temporal covariates. We model the conditional intensity of new COVID-19 cases and deaths in the U.S. at the county level, estimating the dynamic reproduction number of the virus within an EM algorithm through a regression on Google mobility indices and demographic covariates in the maximization step. We validate the approach on both short-term and long-term forecasting tasks, showing that the Hawkes process outperforms several benchmark models currently used to track the pandemic, including an ensemble approach and an SEIR-variant. We also investigate which covariates and mobility indices are most important for building forecasts of COVID-19 in the U.S."

Disease follows SEIR dynamics and county commuting data modulates the spread of disease within counties. \nStay-at-home orders and subsequent social distancing interventions are updated at the state-level according to recent policy documents. Ongoing interventions continued through the remainder of the simulation period. Intervention effects are inferred where possible.\nTo model deaths and hospitalizations in the population, we incorporated realistic but fixed time delays from infection to symptom onset to hospitalization to ICU to ventilator use to death and used age-specific demographics to perform a county-level age standardization of health outcome risk. Currently, we assume a 0.5% infection fatality rate and a 3.5:1 ratio of incident hospitalizations to deaths. \nFor each county, we estimate the seeding time and amount, the baseline reproductive number, the case confirmation to infection ratio, and the effectiveness of interventions (from closing to phased reopenings). We use an MCMC-like inference procedure that calibrates model outputs to weekly county aggregations of incident confirmed cases and deaths as reported by USA Facts. For the inference of the baseline reproductive number and the case confirmation to infection ratio, hierarchical grouping terms enable sharing of strength among counties in the same state.\nOur procedure forecasts incident and cumulative deaths by incorporating the last reported data point (pre-forecast date) from USA Facts.\nThe estimates reported by this model incorporate uncertainty in both epidemiological parameters (e.g., R0, infectious period, time delays to health outcomes) and the effectiveness of state-wide intervention policies on social distancing, stay-at-home orders, and phased reopenings.

Upon initiation of projections, all counties with 10 or more confirmed cases impose a 20% contact rate reduction. Each week following, if a county newly exceeds 10 confirmed cases, a 20% contact rate reduction is imposed, depending on the projection scenario. Counties that had previously exceeded 10 confirmed cases and also experience an increase in the number of weekly reported confirmed cases impose a further, multiplicative 20% contact rate reduction, depending on the projection scenario.

Weights are estimated separately for each combination of geographic scale (county, state, or national) and prediction target variable (inc case, inc hosp, inc death, cum death). Model weights are estimated by optimizing the mean weighted interval score (WIS) of the ensemble forecasts in past weeks, subject to the constraints that the weights are non-negative and sum to 1, and the predictive quantiles are properly ordered. We select an ensemble specification with best mean WIS across all past weeks in a retrospective evaluation; a separate specification may be selected for each combination of geographic scale and prediction target variable. We consider variations on training that use a single shared weight across all quantile levels for each model, separate weights for each quantile level, or three groups of quantile levels (the four in the lower tail, the 15 in the middle, and the 4 in the upper tail). We also consider varying ranges for how many past weeks of forecasts are used in weight estimation, from 3 weeks to 10 weeks (except at county level, where we only consider window sizes of 3 weeks). For the national and state level, we also consider estimation jointly across those geographic units. During the weight estimation process, any missing forecasts are mean-imputed; the estimated weights are then redistributed to account for missingness patterns (so that models with missing forecasts in the training window will have their estimated weight discounted)."

To arrive at the best model, we experimented with a large range of mechanistic and statistical models and competed these models against each other. For mechanistic models, we tried SEIR models and curve fitting models. For the statistical model, we tried linear model and a simple multilayer perceptron. We experimented with statistical models enforcing constraints among different numbers of the mechanistic parameters. We also tried models with priors and without. We also varied how much of the trajectories are fitted with the model (last 4 week, 6 week, and so forth). Including all combinatorial choices, we ended up with 450 different models. We evaluated model performance with split dates trained in the past and chose the best models. The best models ended up being (i) a multiplicative growth model for the mechanistic term with a linear statistical model in which the statistical model enforces constraints on all mechanistic parameters. (ii) A curve fitting mode [CITE paper] with a pseudolikelihood prior, together with a linear statistical model on all mechanistic parameters. The predictions here ensemble these two models."

Because the infections curve is unique for every region, we let the model use each region's own data to learn the best set of parameters for that region. This includes parameters such as: mortality rate, initial R_0, post-lockdown R, and the inflection date of any lockdowns. Other variables such as the latency period, infectious period, and virus shedding period are fixed based on published literature. After some additional validation techniques to minimize overfitting, we use the learned parameters to simulate the future and make projections.

Our model can consider the effect of many complexities of the epidemic process and yet be simplified to a few parameters that are learned using fast linear regressions. Therefore, our approach can learn and generate forecasts extremely quickly. On a 2 core desktop machine, our approach takes only 3.18s to tune hyper-parameters, learn parameters and generate 100 days of forecasts of reported cases and deaths for all the states in the US. The total execution time for 184 countries is 11.83s and for more than 3000 US counties is 101.03s. Despite being fast, the accuracy of our forecasts is on par with the state-of-the-art as demonstrated on the leaderboard page. at https://scc-usc.github.io/ReCOVER-COVID-19. Our model is able to quickly adapt to changing trends, and the variations in parameters during different times/policies allow us to forecast different scenarios such as what would happen if we were to disregard social distancing suggestions. For each state, we model hospitalizations as a separate compartment, as a linear function of recent cases with heterogeneous rates. This means that for some hyper-parameter J, those who were infected at time t-1 to t-J will have a separate rate from those infected at t-(J+1) to t-2J, and so on. This is similar to how we perform death forecasts. For long-term forecasts (more than a few days in the future), the cases are forecasted first based on our SIkJalpha model, which forms the input to hospitalization prediction. While we account for changing trends by putting more emphasis on recently seen data, we assume that the trends will remain the same in the future for our point forecasts. We try to account for changing trends in the future in our quantile forecasts by modeling the empirical error our approach makes using a Random Forest."

Specifically, each day's counts are predicted as a linear combination of the counts on a user-specified number of previous days. The goal of the regressors is the determination of an optimal coefficient vector for these predictive linear combinations. The model currently makes predictions based on the previous 14 days.\nOnce the regressors are created, bootstrapping is used to create a spectrum of predictions, from which quantiles are determined."

Each model compartment is sub-divided into nine different age categories. To model the state of Illinois, we divide the state into 3 regions based on similarities in epidemic dynamics. We infer a common statewide pre-intervention transmission rate, and a separate post-intervention transmission rate for each of the three regions. We also infer a region-specific initial number of infected individuals. Other model parameters are informed by Illinois-specific data or best estimates from existing literature. We fit the model to incident in-hospital deaths and confirmed COVID-19 ICU cases prior to May 8, 2020.  For inference, we use maximum likelihood inference via sequential Monte Carlo for partially observed Markov process models (POMP). \t We assume that hospitalized deaths are reported with probability 0.8075. Because we do not know what might cause underreporting of non-hospitalized deaths, our simulations integrate over that uncertainty by assuming that the reporting rate for non-hospitalized deaths is uniformly distributed from 0.25 to 0.75. The model can be adapted to investigate different types of interventions. We currently model shelter-in-place as a reduction in the overall transmission rate, which is shared by all infected individuals, and reductions in age- and location-specific contact rates.\nTo model the relaxing of shelter-in-place interventions, we project four different scenarios. 1) The inferred post-intervention transmission rate remains unchanged. We assume that this is maximum reduction in transmission and call this model CovidIL_100. At our current estimates, this corresponds to a 78% reduction in pre-intervention transmission. 2) Transmission rates increase to 80% of the maximum reduction in transmission according to a logistic function centered on May 29. We call this model CovidIL_80. At our current estimates, this corresopnds to a 74% reduction in pre-intervention transmission. 3) Transmission rates increase to 60% of the maximum reduction in transmission according to a logistic function centered on May 29. We call this model CovidIL_60. At our current estimates, this corresopnds to a 69% reduction in pre-intervention transmission. 4) Transmission rates increase to 40% of the maximum reduction in transmission according to a logistic function centered on May 29.

To get a distribution around the median, we look at how much incidence has changed from week to week in the past, and we allow for the possibility that similar changes will occur again in the future.\nIn more technical detail, forecasts of incidence are generated through the following procedure: 1) Calculate first differences of incidence; 2) Collect all first differences and their negatives; 3) Sample first differences in incidence and add to the most recent observed incidence; 4) Enforce that the mean of the predictive distribution for incidence is equal to the most recent observed incidence; 5) truncate the predictive distribution for incidence at 0.

This new epidemiologically informed risk score leverages subtle geospatial patterns from seasonal flu epidemics of the past, and significantly improves incidence forecasts for COVID-19. Additionally, the UnIT score emerges as the most important factor explaining observed county-specific incidence trends for COVID-19 in the US, with coefficients in multi-variate regression far outweighing those for typical co-variates. Thus, our key insight is that past incidence patterns for a different pathogen can substantially inform current projections, provided the transmission mechanisms are broadly similar. And our key technical contribution is the development of the precise algorithm to transfer this knowledge to the new context, by rigorously estimating thedivergence of hidden generators of complex stochastic phenomena from observation of short sample paths."

Therefore, our approach can learn and generate forecasts extremely quickly. On a 2 core desktop machine, our approach takes only 3.18s to tune hyper-parameters, learn parameters and generate 100 days of forecasts of reported cases and deaths for all the states in the US. The total execution time for 184 countries is 11.83s and for more than 3000 US counties is 101.03s. Despite being fast, the accuracy of our forecasts is on par with the state-of-the-art as demonstrated on the leaderboard page. at https://scc-usc.github.io/ReCOVER-COVID-19. Our model is able to quickly adapt to changing trends, and the variations in parameters during different times/policies allow us to forecast different scenarios such as what would happen if we were to disregard social distancing suggestions. We build a random forest, based on the output of USC_SIkJalpha model along with the data on the cumulative case/death, weekly increase, and previous increase. We then sample trees to generate quantile forecasts"

The model captures both the natural history of the disease and interactions in households, workplaces, schools, and communities. The model was populated with COVID19 parameters from the literature and population-related data from the state of Georgia, including demographic information, household sizes, and travel patterns, and validated using data regarding COVID19 confirmed cases and deaths in Georgia. We have also extended our model to include results for North Carolina using population-related data from the state of North Carolina."

        "methods_long": "The Political Realities Model (PRM) is built on observations of macro-level societal and political responses to COVID19 characterized only in terms of infections and deaths. The starting point of the model is the hypothesis that although individuals and policy makers have responded to the epidemic with a wide variety of behavioral modifications and policy actions, the actual net impact of the measures taken, though not identical across time or geography, is predictable. Moreover, these predictions can be based upon what a society and its elected officials have demonstrated it (they) will accept as a reasonable aggregate impact from COVID19. This model seeks to identify one or more \"acceptability\" range(s) from observation of the epidemic up to the current time and to understand how much impact on infection rates is achieved by responses in this (these) range(s). Deaths, in turn, are related to infections via a simple (time- and geographically-varying) phenomenological model derived through fitting. This allows the model to build in spatiotemporal variation in the demographics of the population, its access to health care & COVID testing, and the actual infection fatality rate without explicitly considering these factors. At present the model is deterministic rather than probabilistic, and so only provides point forecasts. The model considers the United States at the state level."

We produce a number of different intervention scenarios, each assuming various interventions and rates of compliance are implemented in the future. This submission is the selection of the weekly scenario we believe to be most plausible given current observations and planned intervention policies. The selected scenarios are listed below: November 12 - present '5_2xbeta': 5% increase in contact rates for two weeks. The following week, the reproduction number R is set to 1. November 8 - November 11 '5_2xhold': This scenario assumes a weekly 5% increase in contact rates for two weeks. The following week, the reproduction number R is set to 1 for the remainder of the projection. October 4 - November 5 '5_1xhold': This scenario assumes a one-time 5% increase in contact rates, which is applied at the start of the projection and maintained for one week. After one week, the reproduction number R is set to 1 for the remainder of the projection. June 14 - September 27 '5_2xhold': This scenario assumes a weekly 5% increase in contact rates for two weeks. The following week, the reproduction number R is set to 1 for the remainder of the projection.  June 7 '80contact1x5p' : This scenario assumes a weekly 20% decrease in counties with growing weekly cases and stay-at-home orders in place, and a one-time 5% increase in states that have reopened. May 7 - June 4 '80contactw5p': For states maintaining or increasing current social distancing restrictions, we apply a 20% weekly reductions of contact rates, as described above. However, in states that reopen, we apply a weekly 5% increase to the contact rate of counties in those states. May 3 '80contact1x10p': For states maintaining or increasing current social distancing restrictions, we apply a 20% weekly reductions of contact rates, as described above. However, in states that reopen, we apply a one-time 10% increase to the contact rate during the week that the state is scheduled to reopen and maintain this new increased rate for the remainder of the projection. April 12 - April 26 '70contact': This scenario mimics adaptive adjustments in contact imposed both by government regulations (e.g. school closures, restrictions on mass gatherings) and population self-regulation (e.g. isolation, mask wearing, social distancing). Upon initiation of projections, all counties with 10 or more confirmed cases impose a 30% contact rate reduction. Each week following, if a county newly exceeds 10 confirmed cases, a 30% contact rate reduction is imposed, depending on the projection scenario. Counties that had previously exceeded 10 confirmed cases and also experience an increase in the number of weekly reported confirmed cases impose a further, multiplicative 30% contact rate reduction, depending on the projection scenario.

        "methods_long": "We estimate an econometric county panel data model based on the standard SIR model. The econometric model relates the change in log active (new) infections between now and some future horizon to the current transmission rate and the susceptible share of the population. The current transmission rate is assumed to be a function of individuals\u2019 mobility behavior and weather (temperature and precipitation). County level mobility is measured using the Mobility and Engagement Index (MEI) constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas from mobile device geolocation data provided by Safegraph. County level weather data comes from weather station readings on daily-high temperatures and precipitation from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), following the methodology in Wilson (2019). For diseases that convey long-lasting immunity to those who have recovered from infection, the susceptible share is simply one minus the share of the local population that have previously been infected. We assume this share in a given county is proportional to cumulative confirmed cases to date as a share of the county\u2019s population. This proportionality also implies that the change in log active infections can be proxied by the change in log active cases. Aside from mobility, weather, and accumulated natural immunity, there are two other important elements of the econometric model. The first is lagged infection growth, allowing for the possibility that lagged infection growth is predictive of subsequent infection growth. The second additional element is county-specific intercepts (fixed effects), which allow each county to have a different mean level of infection growth, independent of the other elements of the model."
